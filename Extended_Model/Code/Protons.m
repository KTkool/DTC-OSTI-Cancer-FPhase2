% We will need to replace some of the entries later to account for
% boundaries

% this is sort of a tridiagonal matrix, just with 5 diagonals
% main diagonal
va = -4*ones(1,N*M);
M1a = diag(va);
% off diagonal for left and right element of the difference stencil
vb = ones(1,N*M-1);
M1b = diag(vb,1) + diag(vb,-1);
% other two diagonals for top and bottom element of the difference stencil
vc = ones(1,N*(M-1));
M1c = diag(vc,N) + diag(vc,-N);

% FIXME? : Remove this condition to allow
% Acidic resistant cells to have an advantage
% over the other cells. Otherwise it is just 
% impossible to go throught the basement
%membrane
% constant concentration at the bottom
%Matrix(N*(M-1)+1:N*M,:)=0;
%for i=1:N
%    Matrix(N*(M-1)+i,N*(M-1)+i)=1;    
%end

% the difference stencil is not adapted to simulate drainage into the vasculature.
% i.e. the constant layer of 0 is moved one line below the plot.


% periodic boundary conditions
% all cells in the right hand boundary
for j=2:M-1
    Matrix(j*N,j*N+1)=0;
    %rather than the  one later we want N-1 earlier
    % you need to set up Matrix yourself to make sense of this
    Matrix(j*N,(j-1)*N+1)=1;
