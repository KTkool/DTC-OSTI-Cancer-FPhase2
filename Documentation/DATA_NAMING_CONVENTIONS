Most data is .mat files, each storing the state of a simulation every few iterations. The naming convention is as follows - 

output_*type of mutant seeded at t=1**repeat number*.mat

types are: ar = acid resistant
		   gly = glycolytic
		   hyp = hypoplastic
		   hyp_mut = hypoplastic with high mutation rate
